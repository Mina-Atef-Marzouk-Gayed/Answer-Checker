# Answer-Checker
This is my first C++ project, a simple quiz program where teachers can create quizzes and students can take them. The program checks answers, calculates the score, and celebrates perfect scores with text-based fireworks. It helped me practice basic programming concepts like loops, arrays, functions, and file handling.
